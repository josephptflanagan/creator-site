                    Hello, I'm the Irresolute Cartographer, and this is a little bit of information about who I am.

                    I'm a lifelong (almost) lover of video games, starting young with Warcraft, Railroad Tychoon, and Doom (the originals). I've been playing games since 
                    floppy disks were actually floppy. I'm also a lover of maps of all types. I believe that maps can be one of the most effective tools in storytelling,
                    and I've drawn maps for fun since the third grade. Other than gaming and cartography, I enjoy learning as much as I can about almost any topic. In
                    literature I thoroughly enjoy the works of Robert Heinlein, Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven, especially "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress," "Lucifer's Hammer,"
                    and "Falkenberg's Legion."

                   I'm currently a manufacturing/mechanical engineer by trade, though I apsire to move into the world of software development and love making videos for my
                   YouTube channel. I'm a native Texan, where I live with my wife, dog and two cats.
