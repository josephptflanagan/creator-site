# Creator Site

## I'm creating my own creator site with blog, video streaming, a shop (once I have something to sell), etc.

### This is going to be a pig project, and I'm going have to utilize much of my knowledge (e.g. personal site basics, creating front and back user sides for adding my content, creating a blog with all associated features, payment processing, e-commerce), and learn a lot on the way (e.g. video streaming, email integration, and I'm sure a lot I don't know that I don't know).
